# Welcome to the Assimilation README file.

The project home page is here :
http://linux-ha.org/source-doc/assimilation/html/index.html

A more detailed Getting Started guide can be found here

This code builds with cmake.

## Dependencies

We like to have a reasonable number of things in the build environment.
- Cmake (and cpack) - http://cmake.org/
- C compiler (gcc, clang, or MS VC tools) - http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/ <i>et al</i>
- make tools - like Gnu make, or MSVC - http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ <i>et al</i>
- Recent version of Glib2 - http://developer.gnome.org/glib/
- libpcap (or winpcap) - http://www.tcpdump.org/
- pkg-config (even for Windows) - http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config
- valgrind - The 'C' level tests use it - http://valgrind.org/
- Testify - testing framework from Yelp - https://github.com/Yelp/Testify (<tt>pip install testify</tt>)
- doxygen (for documentation) - http://doxygen.org/
- dot (for doxygen graphs) - http://www.graphviz.org/
- Ctypesgen ( for the CMA code) http://code.google.com/p/ctypesgen/ (<tt>pip install ctypesgen</tt>)

In addition, the following systems are needed in the runtime environment for the CMA:
- Neo4J - http://neo4j.org/
- py2neo - http://py2neo.org/	(<tt>pip install py2neo</tt>)

## GettingSource 

Getting Source for the Assimilation Monitoring Project
The source to the Assimilation Project can be found at http://hg.linux-ha.org/

## MakingIt 

Making The Assimilation Monitoring System from Source is done with cmake.


### MakingItForLinux 

Making The Assimilation Monitoring System for *NIX Systems
If not, you can follow these instructions for *NIX type systems.
- Extract the source into "path-to-source-directory"
- mkdir "path-to-binary-directory"
- cd "path-to-binary-directory"
- cmake "path-to-source-directory"
- make install

### MakingRPMandDEBPackages 

Making RPM or DEB packages
The Cmake project provides cpack to make minimal RPM and DEB packages
Cpack also makes OS X and Windows packages - but that's untested.
Patches to make this work would be appreciated.

The procedure for making packages is as follows:

- Extract the source into "path-to-source-directory"
- mkdir "path-to-binary-directory"
- cd "binary-directory"
- cmake "path-to-source-directory"
- cpack

If it can't figure out which kind of package to build, it will default to building RPMs.
Patches are being solicited to build Windows and OS X packages (read the cpack docs).
Other package formats aren't supported by cpack, and will have to be supported by other mechanisms.

### MakingItForWindows 

Making The Assimilation Monitoring System for Windows
- That's something we need to work out.  An earlier verison of 'nanoprobe' did compile and run successfully on Windows

## TestingIt

Running our Tests
There are currently two test modules that you can run after building it.  They can be run
like this:
- cd testcode; sh path-to-source-tree/testcode/grind.sh	# Assumes you have valgrind installed.
- cd testcode; ./pinger ::1				# Does a ping test of reliable UDP
- cd cma; testify tests					# Runs significant python tests

For the testcode piece, you have to be in the cma directory of <i>build tree</i>.
For the testify portion, you have to either be in the cma directory of the source tree
or the installed version in the python install place
(on my machine that's currently /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/assimilation)
