 * @brief Defines a set of value types - used for semi-intelligent dumping of TLV data.
 * @details It defines a set of <i>data</i> types. Each <i>TLV</i> type is an object of a certain data type.
 * We define those common sets of data types here.
 * BUT THIS HEADER DOESN'T SEEM TO BE USED! - and I think the concept has changed since I wrote it. (?)
 *
 * This file is part of the Assimilation Project.
