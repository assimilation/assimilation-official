  Here's what remains to be done for this release:
  - Generate a CMA docker image (which we're doing here...)
  - Generate a nanoprobe docker image based on our assimilation published base image

Here's the minimum of what needs to go into the nanoprobe image:
  - Our assimilation published base image: docker assimilationproject/meson-centos6:0.0.1
  - C source and headers
  - libpcap (built from source because I needed a static version of the library)
  - libsodium (built from source because the version in CentOS 6 was an early prerelease)
  - glib2.0 (which I just used from the CentOS6 version)
  - meson.build file

Here's the minimum of what needs to go into the server Docker image:
  - a suitable Python-2.6.x friendly base image
  - CMA subdirectory - including AssimCtypes.py
  - requirements.txt - and all the associated subpackages
  - Assimilation client shared library (from nanoprobe image?)
  - libpcap
  - libsodium
  - glib2.0

Questions:
  Can the C shared library come from our generated version? (I suspect not)
