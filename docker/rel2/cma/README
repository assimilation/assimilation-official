This software is a container just to simplify packaging. It's not very containery ;-)
Here's how this container works:

 - It needs for the following volumes to be available from the real system:
   - /usr/share/assimilation
   - /var/lib/assimilation
   - /run - mounted from /run or /var/run (??)
   - /var/run/docker.sock
 - It needs to be able to start stop and otherwise control a neo4j container
 - It needs to do its own install in /usr/share and /var/lib if that isn't present...
 - It needs to dbus package installed before docker.io gets installed
 - It needs to have docker.io package installed
 - It needs to start as root and downgrade to non-root (assimilation) user id


 Things I still need to do before this container is complete:
  - Create AssimCtypes.py using ctypesgen...
#
# Need to create a 'cma' script that starts the container as follows:
  - -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  - -v /usr/share/assimilation:/usr/share/assimilation
  - -v /var/lib/assimilation:/var/lib/assimilation
