## [1.99.1-pre] - Oct 30, 2020
- Testing release automation

## [1.1.7] - Jun 12, 2016 - the "From The Heart" release
### New Features
- Added two subgraph queries to assimcli
- Changed <i>drawwithdot</i> to use subgraph queries - much faster results
- Added support for Docker containers
- Added support for Vagrant VMs
- Updated to Neo4j 3.0.1
- Updated to Py2neo 2.0.8

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an obscure bug in the fileattrs discovery script

### Caveats
- Neo4j 3.x requires Java 1.8 - this eliminates some platforms
- Not compatible with database formats before 1.1.0
- No alerting, or interface to existing alerting beyond a sample email script. (hooks to build your own interface are included)
- high availability option for the CMA is roll-your-own using Pacemaker or similar
- queries could benefit from more indexes for larger installations.
- The CMA will suffer performance problems when discovering IP addresses when large numbers of nanoprobes are on a subnet.
- no GUI
- Our current process only allows us to create 64-bit binaries. Feel free to build 32-bit binaries yourself. They still work for Ubuntu, and Debian, SuSE and 7.0 and later versions of CentOS.
