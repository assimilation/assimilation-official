/** @page README Assimilation README file
Welcome to the Assimilation README file :-D.

This code builds with cmake, not the autofoo tools...
You can a formatted version of this README online at
http://linux-ha.org/source-doc/assimilation/html/_r_e_a_d_m_e.html


@section Dependencies
We like to have a reasonable number of things in the build environment.
- Cmake - http://cmake.org/
- C compiler (gcc, clang, or MS VC tools) - http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/ <i>et al</i>
- make tools - like Gnu make, or MSVC - http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ <i>et al</i>
- Recent version of Glib2 - http://developer.gnome.org/glib/
- libpcap (or winpcap) - http://www.tcpdump.org/
- pkg-config (even for Windows) - http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config
- valgrind - The 'C' level tests use it - http://valgrind.org/
- Testify - testing framework from Yelp - https://github.com/Yelp/Testify
- doxygen (for documentation) - http://doxygen.org/
- dot (for doxygen graphs) - http://www.graphviz.org/
- Ctypesgen will become mandatory http://code.google.com/p/ctypesgen/

In addition, the following systems are needed in the runtime environment for the CMA:
- Neo4J - http://neo4j.org/
- py2neo - http://py2neo.org/	(<tt>pip install py2neo</tt>)

@section MakingIt Making The Assimilation Monitoring System from Source
If you know how to use cmake, you probably already know what to do.

@subsection MakingItForLinux Making The Assimilation Monitoring System for *NIX Systems
If not, you can follow these instructions for *NIX type systems.
- Extract the source into "path-to-source-directory"
- mkdir "path-to-binary-directory"
- cd "path-to-binary-directory"
- cmake "path-to-source-directory"
- make install

You currently have to install it in order to run the tests.

@subsection PackagingIt Making Packages
The code is currently set up to be able to make RPM or DEB packages using the cpack command (related to cmake)
- Extract the source into "path-to-source-directory"
- mkdir "path-to-binary-directory"
- cd "binary-directory"
- cmake "path-to-source-directory"
- cpack

If it can't figure out which kind of package to build, it will default to building RPMs.
Patches are being solicited to build Windows and OS X packages (read the cpack docs).
Other package formats aren't supported by cpack, and will have to be supported by other mechanisms.

@subsection MakingItForWindows Making The Assimilation Monitoring System for Windows
- Looking for someone to take this over.  Patches are being accepted ;-)

@section TestingIt Running our Tests
There are currently two test modules that you can run after building it.  They can be run
like this:
- cd testcode; sh path-to-source-tree/testcode/grind.sh	# Assumes you have valgrind installed.
- cd testcode; ./pinger ::1				# Does a ping test of reliable UDP
- cd cma; testify tests					# Runs significant python tests

For the testcode piece, you have to be in the cma directory of <i>build tree</i>.
For the testify portion, you have to either be in the cma directory of the source tree
or the installed version in the python install place
(on my machine that's currently /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/assimilation)
