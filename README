/** @page README Assimilation README file
Welcome to the Assimilation README file :-D.

This code builds with cmake, not the autofoo tools...
You can a formatted version of this README online at
http://linux-ha.org/source-doc/assimilation/html/_r_e_a_d_m_e.html


@section Dependencies
We like to have a reasonable number of things in the build environment.
- Cmake - http://cmake.org/
- C compiler (gcc, clang, or MS VC tools) - http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/ <i>et al</i>
- make tools - like Gnu make, or MSVC - http://www.gnu.org/software/make/ <i>et al</i>
- Recent version of Glib2 - http://developer.gnome.org/glib/
- libpcap (or winpcap) - http://www.tcpdump.org/
- pkg-config (even for Windows) - http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config
- valgrind - The 'C' level tests use it - http://valgrind.org/
- Testify - testing framework from Yelp - https://github.com/Yelp/Testify
- doxygen (for documentation) - http://doxygen.org/
- dot (for doxygen graphs) - http://www.graphviz.org/
- Ctypesgen is good to have around http://code.google.com/p/ctypesgen/

@section MakingIt Making The Assimilation Monitoring System from Source
If you know how to use cmake, you probably already know what to do.

@subsection MakingItForLinux Making The Assimilation Monitoring System for *NIX Systems
If not, you can follow these instructions for *NIX type systems.
- Extract the source into "path-to-source-directory"
- mkdir "path-to-binary-directory"
- cd "binary-directory"
- cmake "path-to-source-directory"
- make install

You currently have to install it in order to run the tests.

@subsection MakingItForWindows Making The Assimilation Monitoring System for Windows
- Ask Roger :-D

@section TestingIt Running our Tests
There are currently two test modules that you can run after building it.  They can be run
like this:
- cd testcode; sh path-to-source-tree/testcode/grind.sh	# Assumes you have valgrind installed.
- cd cma; testify tests					# Runs significant python tests

For the testcode piece, you have to be in the cma directory of <i>build tree</i>.
For the testify portion, you have to either be in the cma directory of the source tree
or the installed version in the python install place
(on my machine that's currently /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/assimilation)


@section OtherTargets Other Make Targets
- doc - makes the documentation If you just want to view the latest version online,
go to http://assimmon.org/

For reasons unclear to me, Cmake likes to put lots of full pathnames into its files.
I would hope it would be sufficient to say cmake before making things and it should go from there.

However, failing that, try removing files named like these:
- CMakeCache.txt
- cmake_install.cmake
- Makefile
- CMakeDirectoryInformation.cmake
- CMakeOutput.log
- Makefile2
- TargetDirectories.txt
