@section WhyAContributorAgreement Why A Contributor Agreement?
Contributor agreements are provided for a few reasons:
- Ensure the legal integrity of the project - so that everyone asserts that they're providing original code to the project.
  This protects users and other contributors.
- Create a single legal entity that could easily enforce terms of the licenses.
- Ensure that no one is submitting code that they know to be covered by patents, and dealing with the cases where there might be such patents.
- Provide for the ability to change licenses in the future.  Depending on the future legal landscape, it might prove desirable
  to switch licenses at some time in the future.  In addition, it creates the possibility to offer supported commercial versions
  of the project under a different license.

@section ContributorAgreement The Assimilation Contributor Agreement
The Assimilation project's contributor agreements are borrowed from the <a href="http://harmonyagreements.org">Harmony Project</a>
agreements.  They provide an excellent <a href="http://harmonyagreements.org/guide.html">guide</a> to understanding
these contributor agreements.

Note that this agreement does not require you to assign your copyrights (like the FSF for example), but only to share your copyright rights with the project.
<i>You do not lose any rights to your contribution by signing this contribution agreement</i>.
