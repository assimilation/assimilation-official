The version of the source from which these documents were created is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 or any later version at your option.
Please note that any discovery or monitoring scripts that you author
<i>are not required to be under the GPL</i> because they are invoked through fork and exec not through library linking.

If there are any source files which are not marked in this fashion, it is a clerical error.
Those files are also provided under these same terms.

@section WhyAContributorAgreement Why A Contributor Agreement?
Contributor agreements are provided for a few reasons:
- Ensure the legal integrity of the project - so that everyone asserts that they're providing original code to the project.
  This protects users and other contributors.
- Create a single legal entity that could easily enforce terms of the licenses.
- Ensure that no one is submitting code that they know to be covered by patents, and dealing with the cases where there might be such patents.
- Provide for the ability to change licenses in the future.  Depending on the future legal landscape, it might prove desirable
  to switch licenses at some time in the future.
  In addition, it creates the possibility to offer supported commercial versions
  of the project under a different license in order to provide better support for the project
  and its users.

@section ContributorAgreement The Assimilation Contributor Agreement
The Assimilation project's contributor agreements are borrowed from the <a href="http://harmonyagreements.org">Harmony Project</a>
agreements.  They provide an excellent <a href="http://harmonyagreements.org/guide.html">guide</a> to understanding
these contributor agreements.

Note that this agreement creates a rights sharing arrangement with the project.
<i>You do not lose any rights to use or relicense your contribution any way you wish by signing this contribution agreement</i>.
